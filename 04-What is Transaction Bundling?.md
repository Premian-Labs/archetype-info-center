## What is Transaction Bundling?

Transaction bundling is a system that simplifies and condenses complex actions for users that are making transactions.

This enables new tools and features that would normally be too complicated to execute, all while reducing overall transaction costs for users. 

Price Protection is an example of a feature directly enabled by transaction bundling. With this feature enabled, Archetype bundles swaps with a put option purchase transaction.

With transaction bundling, only your imagination is the limit. More to come soon.
