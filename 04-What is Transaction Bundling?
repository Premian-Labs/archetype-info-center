## What is Transaction Bundling?

Transaction bundling is a transaction management system native to Smart Accounts that simplifies and condenses complex actions for users that are making transactions. Just like Smart Accounts, transaction bundling is another feature falling under the umbrella of Account Abstraction.

Price Protection is a feature directly enabled by transaction bundling. When executing a token swap with protection enabled, Archetype bundles the swap with a put option purchase transaction. With transaction bundling, only your imagination is the limit. More to come soon.
