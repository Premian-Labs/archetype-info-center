# What is Price Protection?

Price Protection is an optional feature that allows users to hedge their token swaps from unwanted downside risk. When executing a swap with Price Protection, a Put Option on the underlying token is automatically purchased within the same transaction. 

Archetype natively integrates Premia Blue as the back-end for Price Protection. To learn more about options and Premia Blue, visit the [Premia Academy](https://academy.premia.blue/).
