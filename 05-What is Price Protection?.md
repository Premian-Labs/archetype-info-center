## What is Price Protection?

Price Protection is an optional feature that helps users safeguard their token exchanges from sudden drops in value.

When using Price Protection, tokens received are shielded against price decreases for a selected period. 

This feature works by purchasing a put option during the transaction, which acts as insurance against the token's value falling. For those familiar with options strategies, this is similar to a 'protective put'.

Archetype integrates Premia Blue for handling these options. To learn more about options and Premia, visit the [Premia Academy](https://academy.premia.blue/).
