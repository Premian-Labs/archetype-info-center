# What is a Smart Account?

### Smart Accounts

Smart Accounts are a secure and more convenient alternative to traditional browser wallets (EOA). 

Using a Smart Account enables things like social login, gas-free transactions, and other seamless user operations. Think of your Smart Account as a proxy that abstracts away the frictions of DeFi to give users more control and freedom over their activities - a concept also known as account abstraction.

### Transaction Bundling

Transaction bundling is a transaction management system native to Smart Accounts that simplifies and condenses complex actions for users that are making transactions. Just like Smart Accounts, transaction bundling is another feature falling under the umbrella of Account Abstraction.

Price Protection is a feature directly enabled by transaction bundling. When executing a token swap with protection enabled, Archetype bundles the swap with a put option purchase transaction. With transaction bundling, only your imagination is the limit. More to come soon.
