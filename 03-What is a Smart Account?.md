## What is a Smart Account?

Smart Accounts are a secure and more convenient alternative to traditional browser wallets. Using a Smart Account enables things like Price Protection, social login, and gasless transactions. Think of your Smart Accounts as sub-accounts that are controlled by your browser wallet.

Instead of posting transactions like you normally would using browser wallets, Smart Accounts allow you to sign simple messages to approve actions on Archetype. Convenient!

Additionally, Smart Accounts unlock sponsored transactions, meaning your transactions on Archetype are completely on us. Archetype will eventually begin amassing transaction fees, so enjoy it while you can.
