# What is a Smart Account?

### Smart Accounts

Smart Accounts are a secure and more convenient alternative to traditional browser wallets (EOA). 

Using a Smart Account enables things like social login, gas-free transactions, and other seamless user operations. Think of your Smart Account as a proxy that abstracts away the frictions of DeFi to give users more control and freedom over their activities - a concept also known as account abstraction.
