# What is Archetype?

**Archetype** is a swap aggregator that integrates derivatives, core DeFi primitives and yield under the same user-friendly platform. Users can swap to- and from any token on Arbitrum with an optional price protection feature for select tokens while earning XP.

Additionally, Archetype natively incorporates smart accounts for easy DeFi onboarding, social login and recovery features, and gas-free transactions. This platform is developed and designed with love for DeFi veterans and newbies alike, with the concrete goal of removing all unnecessary DeFi friction.

Our roadmap includes integrating more DeFi primitives throughout Archetype's development cycle. Eventually, our vision will materialize into the archetypical, interoperable, and composable all-in-one DeFi onboarding hub.
