## What is a Swap?

Swapping means trading one token for another at the current market price. For example, a swap could simply mean exchanging ETH for BTC. DeFi swaps can be executed 24/7 by anyone, anywhere without the need for a third party facilitator. Successful swaps on Archetype can be viewed inside the Transaction History.
