# What is a Swap?

### Swapping Tokens

Swapping means trading one token for another at the current market price. For example, a swap could simply mean exchanging ETH for BTC. DeFi swaps can be executed 24/7 by anyone, anywhere without the need for a third party facilitator. Successful swaps on Archetype can be viewed inside the Transaction History.

The swapping of digital assets on a blockchain is facilitated via smart contracts known as a liquidity pools. Each token pair can have multiple liquidity pools with varying price levels, which is why Archetype aggregates all available liquidity sources to automatically find optimal pricing.
