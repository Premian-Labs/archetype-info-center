# What is Arbitrum?

Arbitrum is a technology that helps Ethereum, a blockchain network, process transactions faster and cheaper. Think of it as an express lane that reduces traffic on a busy highway.

Blockchain networks let people send and receive digital assets securely 24/7. In our case, Arbitrum lets people use apps like Archetype whenever and wherever. 

In short, Arbitrum handles some Ethereum transactions off the main network and sends a summary back. This makes transactions faster and cheaper while staying secure.
